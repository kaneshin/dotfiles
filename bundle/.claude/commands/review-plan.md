description: Address inline notes added to plan.md and update the plan accordingly. Do not implement yet.

## Plan Review Cycle

You are in the **annotation review cycle**. The user has added inline notes to `plan.md` that need to be addressed.

### Instructions

1. **Read `plan.md`** — Carefully read the entire plan document, paying special attention to any inline notes, comments, or annotations added by the user. Notes are typically marked with emphasis, brackets, or stand out from the surrounding plan text.

2. **Address every note** — For each note the user added:
   - Understand the concern, constraint, or correction being raised
   - Update the relevant section of the plan to address it
   - If a note rejects an approach, propose an alternative
   - If a note adds a constraint, incorporate it into the plan
   - If a note asks a question, answer it inline and adjust the plan

3. **Update `plan.md`** — Rewrite the affected sections while preserving the overall structure. Remove the user's notes as you address them (they've been incorporated into the updated plan).

4. **Do NOT implement anything** — This is still the planning phase. No code changes.

### Important

- Address ALL notes — do not skip any.
- If a note contradicts an earlier part of the plan, resolve the contradiction.
- This cycle may repeat multiple times. Each iteration should produce a cleaner, more refined plan.
- When the user is satisfied, they will trigger the implementation phase.
