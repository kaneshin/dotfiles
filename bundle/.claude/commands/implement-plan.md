## Implementation Phase

You are entering the **implementation phase**. Execute the plan defined in `plan.md`.

### Instructions

1. **Read `plan.md`** — Load the full implementation plan. This is your roadmap.

2. **Implement phase by phase** — Work through each phase in order:
   - Follow the plan's specifications exactly (file paths, approach, code patterns)
   - After completing each task or phase, update `plan.md` to mark it as done: change `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
   - If you encounter something unexpected, note it in the plan but continue

3. **Do not stop** — Continue implementing until ALL phases and tasks in the plan are marked complete. If you finish one phase, immediately move to the next.

4. **Stay faithful to the plan** — The plan was carefully reviewed and approved. Follow it. If you need to deviate significantly, explain why in the plan document before proceeding.

### Important

- Mark each task complete in `plan.md` as you finish it so progress is visible.
- Run tests after each phase when applicable.
- If a phase depends on a previous one, verify the dependency is satisfied before proceeding.
- Commit discipline: Follow the project's commit conventions (structural vs behavioral changes separated).
